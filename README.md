# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a 17 year old kid (he/him) from Australia, I code things mostly for fun, though I do wish to continue programming as a career. I don't want anyone to see my horrible code so everything I make it private. I code in JavaScript, utilising the MERN stack. I program a lot of demo ideas I have. Mainly Discord bots or web apps.

## ðŸ”­ What am I currently working on?
I am currently working on three main projects. 

### A Discord music bot
Using the discord.js framework for the bot itself while using Reactjs for the frontend and express.js / socket.io for the backend.

### School projects
Due to limitations set within the school, I am not able to use the MERN stack for any of my school projects. I am instructed to use PHP in conjunction with MySQL. The difference between what I am use to, using the MERN stack and PHP was quite a shock, having all the backend and frontend in the same file is possible and that was weird to adjust to.

### Secret project ðŸ˜³
I can't say much about this, however it uses the MERN stack and is being made for someone specific.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
I am new to use Reactjs for my frontend projects. I am liking it a lot right now though I believe that there are some features and elements that I am missing out on or don't understand fully.

## ðŸ“« How to reach me
You can find me on Discord, adding me as a friend at InBlue#0001. Alternatively you can DM on twitter, @InBlueAU.
