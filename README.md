# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an 18 year old kid (he/him) from Australia, I code things mostly for fun, though I do wish to continue programming as a career. I don't want anyone to see my horrible code so everything I make is private. I code in JavaScript, utilising the MERN stack. I program a lot of demo ideas I have. Mainly Discord bots or web apps.

## ðŸ”­ What am I currently working on?

### [Dank Memer](https://dankmemer.lol/ "Dank Memer's Website") frontend
I am the current frontend developer working on the Dank Memer Discord bot website. It is great to work on something such as this, the people around me are all amazing which obviously makes it a whole lot better!

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently
* Learning the ins and outs of tailwindcss
* Experimenting heavily with Next.js
* Looking into usage of serverless functions in what I make!
