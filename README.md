# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a 17 year old kid (he/him) from Australia, I code things mostly for fun, though I do wish to continue programming as a career. I don't want anyone to see my horrible code so everything I make is private. I code in JavaScript, utilising the MERN stack. I program a lot of demo ideas I have. Mainly Discord bots or web apps.

## ðŸ”­ What am I currently working on?

### [Dank Memer](https://dankmemer.lol/ "Dank Memer's Website") frontend
I am the current frontend developer working with the Dank Memer Discord bot website. It is great to work on something such as this, the people around me are all amazing which obviously makes it a whole lot better!

### A Discord music bot
Using the discord.js framework for the bot itself while using Reactjs for the frontend and express.js / socket.io for the backend.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
Everything I currently am using I would describe myself as proficient in. Though others would probably say otherwise. 

## ðŸ“« How to reach me
You can find me on Discord, adding me as a friend at InBlue#0001. Alternatively you can DM on twitter, @InBlueAU.
